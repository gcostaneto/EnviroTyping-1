# 2016 Post-hoc Analysis

After running the G2F hybrid/weather data through the PReMiuM package there is a large amount of output. There are also many hybrids, so further analysis is needed to answer a few high-level questions:

1.  Which hybrids have profile-clusters that are most different from
    each other (i.e. have the most g x e)?
2.  Which weather variables are most important for making
    profile-clusters that differ across hybrids, i.e. which covariates
    contribute the most to gxe?
3.  Which hybrid-profile clusters define the most similar fields (i.e.
    which field sites are the most redundant)?
4.  Which hybrids diagnose specific envirotype groups?

Before we get started, we need to ensure several packages are loaded into our environment. If you do not currently have these packages, install them before continuing. 

```{r}
library(amap)
library(dynamicTreeCut)
library(cluster)
library(dendextend)
library(lubridate)
library(gridExtra)
library(viridis)
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2)
library(PReMiuM)
```

## Pre-processing the Data

*All below steps, information, and figures are based upon the 2016 monthly, calibrated, and shifted hybrid data. We conduct an analysis on the minima of the variables with non-zero variance.*

Our first goal is to make a single dataframe which includes the yields, hybrid names, and the clusters to which the hybrids are assigned. We will deal with several different paths across the directory, so it's best to first set a working directory that matches file paths on your local machine. If you desire to see the risk profile of certain variables of interest before continuing the analysis, we provide the code to do so in the below snippet, as well.

```{r}
setwd("/Users/banks/RProjects/EnviroTyping/sandbox/shifted_data_analysis/2016")

# Bring in hybrid identifier (col 1), experiment identifier (2), and yield (15) observations 
pedi = read_rds("../../../data/interim/2016/hyb_by_mon_calib_wide_shifted.rds")[,c(1,2,15)]

riskProfObj = read_rds("min_vars_3000/riskProfObj.rds") # Load the min_vars riskProfObj

# Run the below code with different indices to see the risk profile of different variables:
# plotRiskProfile(riskProfObj,
#                 whichCovariates=riskProfObj$riskProfClusObj$clusObjRunInfoObj$covNames[11:20],
#                 outFile="../../working_with_plots/BanksPlots/profile_plot.png")

# Create new dataframe that adds the cluster identifier variable as "clus"
hyb_by_mon_clus = data.frame(clus = as.factor(riskProfObj$riskProfClusObj$clustering),pedi,
                             riskProfObj$riskProfClusObj$clusObjRunInfoObj$xMat[,-1])

colnames(hyb_by_mon_clus) # To verify you have the cluster identifier with other variables
```

## Refine the Clusters

Next, we further group the PReMiuM clusters into more-refined post-hoc groups because there are too many hybrid labels within each cluster to make strong qualitative conclusions. An additional step of clustering is performed using aggolmerative hierarchical clustering to further break down the data. To do this, we utilize the function `hcluster` from the `amap` library because it allows for parallel computing.

During our analysis, we encountered an instance where the types of the variables Exp (experiment identifiers) and Pedi (hybrid identifiers) needed to be converted to factor type variables because they were initially read as character variables. If you come across a similar situation, we have provided our solution in the code below. Finally, we create a new dataframe that includes all of our variables of interest, the hybrids' PReMiuM cluster identifiers, and the hybrids' post-hoc group identifiers. 

```{r}
cores = parallel::detectCores()
posthocGroup = hcluster(hyb_by_mon_clus[,-1], method = "euclidean", link = "ward", nbproc = cores)

# The two categorical variables needed to be converted to type "Factor" to be used with daisy
hyb_by_mon_clus$Exp = as.factor(hyb_by_mon_clus$Exp)
hyb_by_mon_clus$Pedi = as.factor(hyb_by_mon_clus$Pedi)
str(hyb_by_mon_clus) # confirm the first three variables have type "Factor" and the rest "num"

# Establish post-hoc groups for further analysis
dist = daisy(hyb_by_mon_clus)
dynamicCutree = cutreeDynamic(posthocGroup, distM = as.matrix(dist), deepSplit = 4, verbose = 4) 
length(unique(dynamicCutree)) # the number of post-hoc groups should be 4
hyb_by_mon_posthoc = data.frame(group = dynamicCutree, hyb_by_mon_clus) # create a new dataframe with the post-hoc group
```

We would now like to produce some plots to help get a better understanding of the data and the underlying relationships. With a little work, we can answer some of the questions asked at the beginning of this page.

### Intermediate Steps

This section is provided simply to tidy the data and help make clean figures. It is up to you to employ these steps. First, we rearrange the columns to place them in order of month. This is because some variables will have observations from October (month 10) before earlier months. We also change the type of the variable "group" to factor to allow us to change figures' colors based upon the hybrids' groups. Lastly, we assign certain colors to the PReMiuM clusters and the post-hoc groups.

```{r}
hyb_by_mon_posthoc = hyb_by_mon_posthoc[c(3,4,5,1,2,7,8,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,19,20,18,21,22,24,25,23)]
# colnames(hyb_by_mon_posthoc) # can be used to see new order of variables

hyb_by_mon_posthoc$group = as.factor(hyb_by_mon_posthoc$group)

clus.colors = c("1"="#7570B3","2"="#1C9E77","3"="#D95F02","4"="#E72A8A","5"="#E6AB02","6"="#666666")
group.colors = c("1"="#E69F00","2"="#57B4E9","3"="#019E73","4"="#F0E442")
```

## Plotting the Results

We ultimately would like to understand the fundamental differences between the post-hoc groups. We will show several of the more interesting results here. First, we will show cluster yields by their post-hoc groups. 

```{r}
png("../../working_with_plots/BanksPlots/Figures/ClusterYieldsbyGroup.png", width = 1280, height = 1080)
l = list()
for (i in 1:4){
    tmp = hyb_by_mon_posthoc %>% filter(group == i)
    p = ggplot(tmp,aes(clus, Yield)) + 
        geom_bar(aes(fill = clus), width = .5, stat = "summary", fun.y = "mean") + 
        scale_fill_manual(values=clus.colors) +
        labs(title = paste("Average Yield by Cluster for Group",i,sep = " "), x = "Envirotyping Cluster", y = "Yield [bu/acre]") +
        theme_bw() + 
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
        guides(fill=FALSE)
    l[[i]] = p
}
grid.arrange(l[[1]],l[[2]],l[[3]],l[[4]])
dev.off()
```

The above code produces:
